    - Implement a method to allow user to change the sequence in which the listeners are executed in
    - Perhaps a method to allow all the callback functions to be executed concurrently in multiple threads.
    - Implement a show all listener method
    - Implement a remove listener method
        - By probably using a ID that is associated with the enumeration of the callback(s) array

        However when u set the variable with the exact same value, it still runs all the callbacks. Is this good or is this bad?
        Should data watcher's callbacks run when the value is changed, or when set method is called??
        
        So when I use this the publish data thing, when the data is still the same, do I want the data to be published?
